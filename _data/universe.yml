      Like Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, this interconnected universe is designed 
      to be a tapestry of stories that can be enjoyed independently but reward 
      readers who explore multiple works. Each novel and novella shares fundamental 
      cosmological rules while telling its own distinct story.

      The connecting tissue isn't just Easter eggs or cameos—it's a shared 
      understanding of how magic, souls, and the divine interact across all 
      worlds and stories.

  binding_ideals:
    title: "The Binding Ideals"
    content: |
      At the foundation of all magic lies the conflict between two philosophical 
      forces: Transformation and Preservation. These aren't merely abstract 
      concepts—they are fundamental aspects of reality itself, and those who 
      align themselves with one Ideal or the other gain access to power that 
      reflects their chosen philosophy.

      Transformation holds that change is the path to perfection. Nothing should 
      remain static; growth, evolution, and metamorphosis are sacred. Those bound 
      to Transformation can reshape reality—but they themselves are changed by 
      every act of power.

      Preservation holds that what exists has value precisely because it exists. 
      To protect, maintain, and defend is sacred. Those bound to Preservation can 
      shield, restore, and anchor—but they must accept that their power resists 
      the natural flow of change.

  pantheon:
    title: "The Pantheon"
    content: |
      The gods of this universe are not creators but embodiments—manifestations 
      of different aspects of the Binding Ideals. Each god represents a particular 
      expression of Transformation or Preservation, and their interactions with 
      mortals shape the magic systems of individual worlds.

      The Azure God, featured in The Azure Sunrise, represents one such divine 
      expression—a being whose influence spreads like dawn, transforming everything 
      it touches. Other gods embody different facets: preservation through memory, 
      transformation through destruction, preservation through stasis.

  reading_order:
    title: "Reading Order"
    content: |
      Each story is designed to stand alone. However, for those who want to 
      experience the universe in a particular order:

      For the core experience: Start with Threads of the Soul, which establishes 
      the fundamental rules. Then explore The Azure Sunrise for a more intimate 
      look at divine power, and The Tormented Gems for the darker implications 
      of the soul mechanics.

      For a lighter entry: Coronation can be read completely independently and 
      offers a taste of the thematic concerns without requiring knowledge of the 
      broader cosmology.

  development:
    title: "Ongoing Development"
    content: |
      This universe is actively expanding. New connections between existing 
      works are being discovered, and future stories will continue to build 
      on the established framework while exploring new corners of the cosmology.
