about: |
  Music has always been part of my creative process. Sometimes a melody 
  captures a mood I'm trying to evoke in writing; other times, a piece 
  of music becomes the seed for a new story. This page collects my audio 
  experiments and compositions.

  The SoundCloud player above should let you browse and play tracks 
  directly. Feel free to explore, and if something resonates, let me know.

  Some tracks were composed with specific stories or scenes in mind. 
  Music for the interconnected universe often explores the themes of 
  transformation and preservation through sound—building and layering, 
  then stripping away, echoing the fundamental tension at the heart 
  of the cosmology.
