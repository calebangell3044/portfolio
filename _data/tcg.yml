about: |
  TCG Market Sim started as an exploration of what makes trading card games 
  compelling—the anticipation of opening a pack, the joy of pulling a rare 
  card, the satisfaction of completing a collection. This simulator captures 
  that experience in a browser-based format.

  The project also serves as a testing ground for card designs from my 
  various TCG concepts, including Spiritual Possessions—a game connected 
  to the broader themes of my interconnected universe.

cards_info: |
  The cards in TCG Market Sim feature designs from several of my trading 
  card game concepts. Spiritual Possessions draws from the soul-based themes 
  present in my written work—cards that represent spirits, bindings, and the 
  tension between worlds.

  Other card sets may include designs from NEON ECLIPSE, a cyberpunk-aesthetic 
  TCG, and various other concepts I've developed over the years.
