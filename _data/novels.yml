    Threads of the Soul: The Orphan's War is the first book in a planned 
    trilogy that forms the cornerstone of the interconnected universe. In a world 
    where magic flows through the soul and is shaped by philosophical Ideals, 
    five protagonists find their fates intertwined by forces beyond their understanding.

    The magic system is built on the tension between two fundamental Ideals: 
    Transformation—the belief that change is the path to perfection—and 
    Preservation—the conviction that what exists must be protected and maintained. 
    Those who bind themselves to an Ideal gain power, but at the cost of being shaped by it.
  themes: "The nature of belief, how ideology shapes identity, whether we control our beliefs or they control us."
  series_info: "Book One of a planned trilogy. The subsequent books will continue to explore the war between Ideals and its consequences for both the world and the characters bound to it."

    The Tormented Gems is a dark fantasy novel that draws inspiration 
    from Shakespeare's Hamlet while forging its own path through themes of 
    grief, vengeance, and the weight of the dead upon the living. In this world, 
    certain gems can trap the echoes of departed souls—fragments of consciousness 
    that persist beyond death, tormented by their unfinished business.

    The story explores what happens when the dead refuse to stay silent, and 
    when the living must decide whether to honor their demands or break free 
    from the chains of inherited trauma.
  about_gems: |
    The titular gems serve as both plot device and metaphor. Each gem contains 
    a tormented soul, trapped in the moment of their greatest anguish. Those 
    who possess such gems can commune with the dead within—but such communion 
    comes at a cost. The dead are not content to merely advise; they hunger 
    for resolution, and they will use the living to achieve it.
  themes: "Grief, vengeance, the relationship between living and dead, inherited trauma, whether we owe the dead our obedience."
