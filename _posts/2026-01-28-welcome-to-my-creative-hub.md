This is the new home for all my creative projects—novels, games, music, and art. I'll be sharing updates, behind-the-scenes thoughts, and chapter releases here.

## What You'll Find Here

**Writing** — I'm working on several interconnected stories that share a universe, similar to Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere. Each novel explores different aspects of a magic system built on the tension between Transformation and Preservation.

**Games** — From the TCG Market Sim to various game design experiments, I love exploring interactive storytelling.

**Music** — Original compositions and audio experiments that often tie into the worlds I'm building.

**Art** — Physical artwork and visual experiments.

## Current Projects

Right now I'm actively working on:

- **The Azure Sunrise** — A novella about the Azure God and the nature of transformation
- **The Tormented Gems** — A dark fantasy inspired by Hamlet
- **Threads of the Soul** — The cornerstone trilogy of the interconnected universe

Stay tuned for updates, and thanks for visiting!
